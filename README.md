# Applied Machine Learning Systems (2023-24) Code
Project documents the development of CNNs used in a binary and multiclass classification task.

Can output learning curves, confusion matrices, and compute the models' accuracies.

Images used to train the models are obtained from MedMNIST (add link)

## Installation

1. Copy the project files to the user's local machine.
2. Install required libraries (look this up later)

## Running the Code
How to use the code.

Program will prompt user if they want to carry out task a or b first, or exit program.

Once in each task, program will ask user if they want to see the learning curves. Some users may not want to see this because it takes time to generate, so they may say no.

Task A will additionally ask the user if they want to see the misclassified images. Users are free to say no.

Task B does not have this function because Task B has lots of pictures, and printing them out will clog up the user's screen, so this function has not been implemented. But users are free to add this to future versions of the code (please refer to contributing guidelines)

Once the task is done, the user is taken back to the main screen.

Maybe include flowchart for this section?
