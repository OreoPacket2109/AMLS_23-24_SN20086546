# Applied Machine Learning Systems (2023-24) Code
## Project Description
Code for ELEC0134

Code develops CNNs for binary and multiclass classification.

Two CNNs developed for each task to compare different structures' performances.

Code prints out confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and learning curves. (Example images)

## Project Organisation
Folder arrangement.

All files can be run from main.py

Task A tasks are run in Task_A.py, Task B tasks are run from Task_B.py.

## Running the Project
User will be directed to a menu screen where they will be prompted to choose if they want to run Task A or Task B. Must answer A, B, or X.

User will also be asked if they want to see the learning curvse. Learning curves take lots of computational power to generate, and some users' machines may not be able to handle it, so they are given the option to skip this stage.

Program will prompt the user if they want to see misclassified images for Task A, but not Task B. This is because there are more images in Task B than A, making it messy to print them all out.
